## Getting started

To start use the Cedict dictionary library you need to install the package with `npm` or `yarn` at your root project :

```bash
npm install @tykok/cedict-dictionary

yarn add @tykok/cedict-dictionary
```

## `Cedict`

To use the `Cedict` class, you simply need to import it from `@tykok/cedict-dictionary`.


```ts
import Cedict from '@tykok/cedict-dictionary'
```

Next, you can use some function like `getByTraditional()` for example.
With that method you can retrieve a traditional character.

For example with :

```typescript
console.log(Cedict.getByTraditional('‰∏äÂ§©ÂÖ•Âú∞'))
```

You will get :

```js
    { 
        traditional: "‰∏äÂ§©ÂÖ•Âú∞", 
        simplified: "‰∏äÂ§©ÂÖ•Âú∞", 
        pinyin: "shang4", 
        english: "lit. to go up to heaven or down to Hades (idiom)/fig. to go to great lengths/to search heaven and earth/" 
    }
```
