# Issues
## Create an issue

If you spot a problem with :

- The code of the library
- The documentation
- The tests
- The CI/CD
 
Search if an issue already exists. If not, create a new one.
Next, use the templates to create a new issue : 

- [Bug report](https://github.com/Tykok/cedict-chinese-transformation/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug.yml&title=Fix%3A+)
- [Feature request](https://github.com/Tykok/cedict-chinese-transformation/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=feature&projects=&template=feature.yml&title=Feature%3A+)
